A web app that generates variations from a given initial musical phrase. A textual mini-language is defined for the input. The variations are obtained from a series of algorithmic transformations. The user is then offered a pdf score with the results. Written in Common Lisp, uses [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) for the engraving.
